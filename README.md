# Advanced Vision Algorithms

Welcome to the Advanced Vision Algorithms repository!
This project aims to ensure the implementation of vision algorithms as part of
AGH university classes. Here you can find methods of segmentation foreground objects, application of optical flow,
stereo vision, and more.
